                    <h2>Project 1: Manufacturing Technology Curriculum Package</h2>
                    <h3>Situation</h3>
                    <p>In response to the increasing demand for skilled professionals in the manufacturing industry, there was a need to create comprehensive virtual training courses that catered to various skill levels, from beginners to advanced. The target audience included secondary and post-secondary students as well as industry professionals. Additionally, collaboration with industry experts was essential to ensure the courses met industry standards and incorporated the latest technological advancements.</p>
                    <h3>Task</h3>
                    <p>I was tasked with designing, developing, implementing, and maintaining a comprehensive curriculum package of virtual courses for manufacturing technology. The objective was to create over 30 courses that catered to various skill levels, from beginner to advanced. Additionally, I collaborated with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from leading companies in the manufacturing industry to design and implement over 20 specialized courses. These courses focused on multiple machine tools, including Haas, Fanuc, and HURCO, as well as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software like SolidWorks, and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software such as Autodesk Fusion 360 and Mastercam. I also maintained these courses over time, ensuring they remained up-to-date with technological advancements.</p>
                    <h3>Action</h3>
                    <p>I approached the design of each course by leveraging a combination of instructional design models, including ADDIE, SAM, and KEMP. Each of these models contributed to different phases of course development.</p>

                    <p>To ensure each course was outcome-driven and practical, I utilized Action Mapping. This approach helped me design courses with clear, measurable goals that directly addressed the skills and knowledge learners needed. The goals for each course were designed to ensure that learners could apply essential skills and knowledge to real-world scenarios, demonstrating their proficiency through measurable performance benchmarks and practical assessments. By starting the design process with these measurable goals, I ensured that every course was focused on producing specific, actionable outcomes for learners.</p>

                    <p>To develop the virtual training courses, I utilized a range of tools, including Adobe Captivate, Adobe Flash Professional, Snagit, Camtasia, and Immersive Engineering's proprietary authoring system. The courses were deployed through Immersive Engineering's proprietary LMS, and iSpring was used for SCORM-compliant publishing. I incorporated engaging elements such as gamification and video, integrating interactive activities designed to captivate and engage learners. Additionally, I served as an application engineer and SME in developing a desktop application, a CNC machine emulator. I integrated the emulator into the virtual CNC courses, which allowed students to practice their skills and complete assignments in a virtual setting when real-world machines were not practical.</p>

                    <p>Maintaining these courses over time was an ongoing responsibility. I implemented a continuous improvement process that included frequent updates based on software advancements, industry trends, assessment reports, and user analytics. Quality checklists were used throughout this process to ensure that each course met high standards of accuracy, effectiveness, and user engagement. Collaboration with SMEs from leading manufacturing companies was key to integrating up-to-date industry knowledge and ensuring the technical accuracy of each course. This approach ensured that the entire curriculum remained relevant and effective, adapting to the ever-changing technological landscape.</p>

                    <p>Ensuring accessibility was a key priority in the course development process. To achieve this, I employed a detailed quality checklist to verify compliance with WCAG 2.0 standards. This checklist guided the evaluation and adjustment of course materials to ensure they were accessible to all learners, including those with disabilities. By systematically applying these accessibility standards, I was able to create an inclusive learning environment that met the needs of a diverse audience.</p>

                    <h3>Result</h3>
                    <p>The result was a robust curriculum of over 50 virtual courses, 30 of which I independently designed and developed, with the remaining 20 created in collaboration with industry experts. The courses effectively addressed the skills gap in the manufacturing industry, with assessments and feedback indicating that learners were able to apply their new skills in real-world scenarios. Collaboration with SMEs ensured the inclusion of up-to-date industry knowledge and technical accuracy, which was well-received by stakeholders. The continuous improvement process, incorporating frequent updates and adherence to quality checklists, maintained the curriculumâ€™s relevance and effectiveness over time. The success of the courses was demonstrated not only by retaining existing customers but also by achieving approximately 1,100% growth in the customer base over a 15-year period, reflecting the increased reach and impact of the curriculum within the industry. </p>
